## Filesystem Isolation Goals
- [x] Implement chroot() jail for sandboxed processes
- [ ] Provide read-only filesystem mount support
- [ ] Configure mount namespaces via unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)
- [ ] Isolate temporary directories (per-sandbox /tmp)
- [ ] Define directory whitelisting and blacklisting rules
- [ ] Add dedicated filesystem isolation test programs

## Hardening Enhancements
- [x] Introduce seccomp-based system call filtering
- [x] Enable network namespace isolation where applicable *(dev helper script via `unshare --net`)*
- [ ] Implement capability dropping for reduced privileges
